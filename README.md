* Frontend is hosted at: https://yoga.harshg.live & https://fantastic-melba-869e5b.netlify.app/ 

* README.md file and Backend Code (SpringBoot) is available at: https://github.com/h3rs8/form

* Backend is hosted at: https://form-k3s2.onrender.com

* Frontend Code (Angular) is available at: https://github.com/h3rs8/form-front

#### Technology Stack
    Frontend: Angular Framework
    Backend: SpringBoot
    Database: MySQL
  
Iâ€™ve assumed:
1. Each applicant has a unique phone number.
2. There will always be 4 batches in a month at their respective times as provided in the problem statement.
3. One person can enroll in only one slot in a month.
4. The application accepts applications for the current month only.


### Explanation for Database Design 
    @OneToMany Relationship between Year and Month since each year has 12 months.
    @OneToMany Relationship between Month and Batch since each month has 4 batches.
    @OneToMany Relationship between Batch and User since each Batch has multiple customers/users.

    Primary Key for Year is the year itself.
    Primary Key for all other entities is the unique @GeneratedValue Id.

### Frontend
1. Frontend is Created using Angular Framework. I've used Angular Material for theme, form and other elements.
2. For notifications, I have used MatCardModule which gives toast notifications.
3. To connect Frontend with the Backend, I call the REST APIs created in SpringBoot.

### Deployment
1. Azure Database for MySQL is used as database for this project.
2. The SpringBoot Application Backend is deployed on Render.
3. Frontend is deployed with Netlify.
4. To connect Frontend with the Backend, REST APIs are called which are developed with SpringBoot.
